## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I met with Andrew to discuss goals for this semester. What we're going to work on first is to \
> change the mapbox API to apple mapKit. I am going to focus on modifying routes and stops functions. I deleted part of \
> the original ViewController code because it's using mapbox and modified the storyboard to mapkit. Also I added a few \
> more files to split the functions -- functions for routes and functions for stops. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Next week I'm going to focus on displaying the routes using polyline and stops using annotations. 

## Anything Blocking?
