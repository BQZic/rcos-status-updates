## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I found several ways to transfer data between two view controllers, but most of them 
> are based on the navigation controller. I tried to get another view controller by creating
> a new one, but it could not link to the one I needed. Another way is to use Notification 
> center. Probably the task can be done by adding observer and notifier to different view controllers.  

## This Week's Plan

> 1. Work on the presentation. 
> 2. Finish up toggling routes functionality.
