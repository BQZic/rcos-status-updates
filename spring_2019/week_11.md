## Last Week's Accomplishments

> 2. Created a new branch https://github.com/quuu/iShuttleTracker/tree/dynamic_setting_panel
> 3. Worked on settings panel; was trying to build custom table cells but failed because different section cell switches have different functions; the functions should be based off of section header.
