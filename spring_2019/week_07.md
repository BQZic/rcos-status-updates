## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Added prototype cells in settings page, one for toggling routes and one for adding notifications. 
> However, currently it's weird because I cannot set different number of cells in different sections. 

## This Week's Plan

> 1. Display different number of cells in different sections. 
> 2. Clear up the backend since the app crashes after opening it 10 times. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> 

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
