## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This week, I pushed some changes to mapkit_routes branch. I changed the original structure for displaying routes \
> and stops and created routeView and stopView objects, which shrinks the code length of viewController.swift. Also, \
> I managed to add segmented control (for toggling routes) programmatically so that it can dynamically be changed based \
> on whether the route is enabled. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Stop annotations look weird right now, so I need to replace it with the stop image used in shuttles.rpi.edu. \
> Also the position of segmented control is not correct, needs to be fixed.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> None. 

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
