## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Since the stop size will not change according to zoom in values, I needed to find a way to \
> link the zoom value with size of the image. So I wrote functions to detect the zoom value. \
> Also I refactored some code in the ViewController.swift.
