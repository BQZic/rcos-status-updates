## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I was trying to add disable routeView functions, but it seems not possible to transfer data between 
> two view controllers. Since the setting panel is one view controller and the map is another, then if 
> you close "West Campus" in the setting panel, the information needs to transfer to the map and disable
> the west route. 

## This Week's Plan

> 1. Need to find a way to transfer data between two view controllers. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> 

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
