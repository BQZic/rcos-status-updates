## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Rearrange the code, remove unnecessary code. 
> Use Layers instead to display routes, so that there's no need to add/remove the polyline shape in another dictionary, since layer itself has an isVisible function. 
> The overlapping problem: adding an east route layer to the map will overlap the west route layer. Solved by: first add as a polyline, then add to a source, finally add the source to the layer, instead of adding three layers. 

## This Week's Plan
> Work on seperating stops. 
> Also use layers to display stops such that stops won't be underneath of routes. 

## Anything Blocking?
