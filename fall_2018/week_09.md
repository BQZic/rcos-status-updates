## Last Week's Accomplishments
1. Worked on the pull request Matt wrote. This pull request changed the basic structure of the code, modified methods which could make ETA working. 
2. Removed redundant code. I found that actually I didn't need to store all routes in different lists/dictionaries, instead I could just use one dict to access all the data. 
3. Also I didn't need to hardcode the color, I could use for loops instead. 

## This Week's Plan
1. Modify the overall structure of viewcontroller so that the code is more readable. 
2. Since Matt changed the Route struct, I can now directly access the stops on that route. Thus, I could use the Route struct directly to display stops by adding stops to different layers. 
3. Add more comments. 

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing.
