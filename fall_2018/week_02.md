## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Didn't do much, just implemented map using storyboard instead of using codes

## This Week's Plan
> 1. Implement routes and stops
> 2. Review PR

## Anything Blocking?
> There were 6 homeworks and 1 exam last week, so I couldn't find enough time to work on it. 
> This week is not that busy, so I will make up what I didn't do last week.
